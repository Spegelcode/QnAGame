    <h2>This website was made for a school projekt</h2>
    <p>
      It all began with a project I created for a dinner event where my classmates and I set a goal to complete
       and present a small project. For this, I decided to build a Runeword Website based on an old game. 
       The goal was to showcase a list of runewords in the game, which could be viewed and easily navigated.
       At first, I had no idea how to make a website or interact with data, but through this project, I learned 
       an important lesson about how web development works. I discovered that HTML could be dynamically populated with content from external sources using JSON files.
    </p>

    <h3> Here’s what I learned in the process:   </h3>
    <ul>
      <Li>HTML for the structure of the webpage.</Li>
      <Li>JSON for storing and organizing the runeword data.</Li>
      <Li>JavaScript to fetch the data from the JSON file and display it in an interactive manner on the webpage.</Li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This project opened my eyes to the world of web development and led me to pursue more advanced learning in web technologies.
    </p>
    <h2>
      The idea
    </h2>
    <p>
      It all started with a simple question: How can I create a website that not only showcases what I’ve learned in class but also maximizes my learning experience? I wanted to dive deep into web development while also showing my growth.
      Then it hit me: What if I created a game that teaches simple HTML, JavaScript, and CSS concepts? By doing this, I would not only challenge myself to build a website with an interactive game but also have fun while learning.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <Li>Reinforcement: Every time I test and play the game, I reinforce the concepts I’ve learned, strengthening my understanding.</Li>
      <Li>Practical Application: The game gives me a sandbox to experiment and apply new coding skills in a real-world context.</Li>
      <Li>Fun and Engaging: Since I'm playing the game, the learning feels less like a task and more like an interactive experience.</Li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The key benefit of this approach is that while I'm working to perfect the game, I'm playing it, too. By testing the game’s functionality and solving problems in real time, I am learning the same material that I’m teaching through the game.
       This method of learning by doing is powerful because it allows me to see the immediate impact of my work. It's not just theoretical knowledge; I’m actively applying it. 
       In the end, this project isn’t just about creating a game—it's about using the game as a tool to accelerate my learning and make the web development process more enjoyable. 
       As I continue to test and refine the game, I’ll not only improve the final product but also grow as a developer.
